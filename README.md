# MELODICA | Discord Music Bot üéµ

MusicBot stands as the original Discord music bot crafted for [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") 3.8+ utilizing the [pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) library. This bot plays requested songs from YouTube and various other platforms within a Discord server (or multiple servers). Additionally, if the queue becomes empty, MusicBot automatically plays from an existing song list based on its configuration. The bot also incorporates a permission system that empowers owners to restrict commands to specific individuals. Beyond song playback, MusicBot can experimentally stream live media to a voice channel.

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è
Setting up MusicBot is relatively straightforward. Simply follow one of the available [guides](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/). Following this, configure the bot to ensure its seamless integration with Discord.

While the primary configuration file is `config/options.ini`, it's not included by default. To create this configuration, make a duplicate of `example_options.ini` and rename it to `options.ini`. Detailed configuration information can be found in `example_options.ini`.

## GitHub Repositories Are Being Banned üö´
**The reason is the usage of certain words in repository names such as: Hack, Cheat, Hacking Tool, Game Name, Hvnc, Rat, etc.**

Furthermore, tags within repositories are also subject to restrictions. These limitations prevent the utilization of specific keywords I have positioned at the beginning of projects' tags, which are intended to enhance their discoverability.

# Release Source Code Link: [Click Here üîó](HEREEEE)
# Direct Download Source Code:[**Source Code Downloadüì•**](HERREEE)

Despite my attempts to bypass this limitation, regrettably, I did not achieve success. Consequently, I have chosen to place the source code in the Release section. Rest assured, I will include the required source code there, following the same approach as other individuals, rather than providing the executable.
